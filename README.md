## Future improvements (TODO)

> As of now, in the very beginning of this project, this is more of a to do-list rather than improvements I plan to implement in the future.

1. Design and decide on database management systems. Current plan is SQL for more permanent data such as monsters and equipment and MongoDB for more dynamic data such as a characters inventory.
2. Setup an API for all CRUD operations.
3. Implement a simple game engine that returns the winner (and maybe handles rewards such as experience points or gold).
